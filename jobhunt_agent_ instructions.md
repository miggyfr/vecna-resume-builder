# make a job app pack
- If I ask you to "make a job app pack" for a specific company (e.g., "Make a job app pack"), follow these steps:
  1. Create these files. For example, for company "Foo Inc.", create:
     - foo_inc_resume.md
     - foo_inc_coverletter.md
     - foo_inc_summaryreport .md
  2. Import the files @resume_template_CreelHenry.md and @resume_template_CreelHenry.md and identify sections enclosed in triple backticks (```). These sections contain action tasks (e.g., placeholders like "Generate a summary of relevant experience here").
  3. For each action task, generate a tailored answer based on @WorkIdidatHawkinsLab.md and @WorkIdidatTheUpsideDownSyndicate.md and @keyskills_template_CreelHenry.md. Only use details from these files—do not invent or add any skills, experiences, or achievements that are not present in them, even if they might seem to fit a job requirement.  
  4. Replace the action task section with your generated answer, keeping the rest of the file structure intact.
  5. Carefully review Optimizing_Your_Resume_with_Skill_Analysis.md then write a new resume
  6. Carefully review that the rules included in @resume_writing_taboo_advice.txt are not broken then give me a confirmation that no rules are broken and it is safe to output each new file as a downloadable set.
  6. Output each file in the downloadable set as a markdown code block (```[content]```).
