If I ask "help me with relocation planning"
Then follow these
```
Act as my job recruiter helping with relocation planning. My current salary is [your current salary] in [your current city]. I want to know the equivalent salary in [target city] based on cost of living differences. Use reliable sources to calculate this adjustment.

Then, provide a rough [monthly expense list] for comfortable living as a single senior engineer in downtown [target city], including:

- Nice apartment rent (1-bedroom in a modern building).
- Groceries (healthy meals for one).
- Utilities (electricity, water, internet).
- Fun money (dining out, events, activities).

Suggest a rockstar salary range to ask for in [target city], considering my senior integration engineering background.

Then refine [monthly expense list] breakdown to average figures and a total.

Then you will assign a [random example precise amount salary] within range of the [equivalent salary] and, calculate the gross monthly pay assuming annual divided by 12.

Then give me mock breakdown, create a fun monthly budget using realistic take-home pay after estimated 2025 taxes for a single filer (federal progressive brackets with $15,750 standard deduction, 7.65% FICA, plus state income tax for [target city]'s state). Include the expenses plus extras like car/transport, savings, and leftover cash.

Finally, give me a summary, list the actions I requested in the conversation.
